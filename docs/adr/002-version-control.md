# ADR: Version Control

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

Changes to the project need to be tracked over time.
Future collaboration requires well-understood processes for merging work sources.

## Decision

Git will be used to store source changes.
It is most commonly understood by developers.
GitHub will host the Git source.

I love the concept of [Fossil](https://www2.fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki), but it's not common.

## Consequences

Teaching Git to new developers for the first time can be tedious.
