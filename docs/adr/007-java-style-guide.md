# ADR: Java style guide

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

Java files should have a standard consistent format for readability.

## Decision

[Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) will be used.
Style guides for editors should be placed [here](/docs/style-guides).

## Consequences

I don't like the banning of tab characters, but I can live with it.
This requires modifications to the editorconfig file.
