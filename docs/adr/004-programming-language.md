# ADR: Programming language

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

This project will require image processing and website serving at a bare minimum.
These tasks will need to be handled by a program from written code.

## Decision

Java will be used to develop Mighty Metrics server side processing.
It is what I use for my day job, so I am most comfortable and productive with it.
The most recent LTS should be used when possible.

## Consequences

Java is not a fun, new, and exciting language.
It can be verbose and resource heavy.
Many newer developers aren't familiar with it either.
