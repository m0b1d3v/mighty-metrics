# ADR: Project name

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

Naming a project is one of the most important steps to getting started.

## Decision

This project will formally be called "The Mighty Metrics".
I tend to drop any leading "The" in non-formal occasions so likely will be called "Mighty Metrics" in many places.

## Consequences

This might need to be changed later based on any copyright issues.
The Mighty Gym is IP owned by Coach Kugo to the best of my knowledge.
As this is a fan project, whatever they say about the brand goes.
